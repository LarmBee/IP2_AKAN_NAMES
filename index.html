            The greater Akan people (macro-ethnic group) speak Kwa languages. The proto-Kwa language is believed to have
come from East/Central Africa, before settling in the Sahel.
[1] The people who became known as the Akan migrated
from the Sahel to coastal west Africa. The kingdom of Bonoman was firmly established in the 12th century by the
Akan people. Bonoman was a trading state between the Akan and neighboring people especially those from Djenn√©.
During different phases of the Bonoman empire groups of Akans migrated out of the area to create numerous states
based predominantly on gold mining and trading of farm products.[2] [3]
Brief Recent History
From the 15th century to the 19th century, the Akan people dominated gold mining and the gold trade in the region.
From the 17th century on, the Akan were among the most powerful group(s) in west Africa. They fought many
battles against the European colonists to maintain autonomy. During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, enslaved Akans
such as the Coromantins of Jamaica and descendants of the Akwamu in St. John, and many others were responsible
for many slave rebellions in the new world.
By the early 1900s, all Akan lands in Africa were colonized or protectorates of the French and English. On the 6th of
March 1957, Akan lands in the Gold Coast rejected British rule, by the efforts of Kwame Nkrumah, and were joined
with British Togoland to form the independent nation of Ghana. The Ivory Coast became independent on 7 August
1960.
