                The ceremony starts with an opening libation (mpaeɛ) poured by an elder who announces the occasion and the purpose of it. The mother's family provides the drink used for this libation, which is poured at every doorstep and the main entrance to the house. 
                The father's family provides the drink for the second libation. After this libation, the child is brought out and stripped naked. The child is then placed on a prepared area of the ground or on a comfortable cushion.
                Around 7 a.m., when all guest have arrived, a female or male elder of the father takes the child to her or his lap and both the water and the gin is poured into separate glasses. Naming the child is the responsibility of the father's family. 
                The father's female or male elder then dips her or his forefinger into the gin or uses a leaf and then drops it on the child's tongue and says, "when we say that it is gin (symbolic of untruth), say that it is gin" (sɛ yɛka se nsa a ka se nsa) three times. 
                The elder does the same with the water: "when we say that it is water (symbolic of truth), say that it is water" (sɛ yɛka se nsuo a ka se nsuo). Both of these tastings advise the child to seek and tell the truth and to distinguish it from falsehood as she or he tries to live a righteous and ethical life.
                The child's name is given by the father (agya) and the child is then given a name: we will call you ____ and this name means _________ (yɛbɛfrɛ wo ______ ne asekyerɛ din yɛ ______). From today onward, we will call you _____ (ɛfiri nne rekɔ yɛbɛfrɛ wo _____). 
                The second name of the child can come from consulting an ɔkɔmfoɔ (spiritualist/healer) or ɔbosomfoɔ (spiritualist/healer), an elder or ancestor of the father's family of good character, circumstances of the child's birth, and the like.
